# Display UI by FreddyWare #

Display UI consists of a _client_ built in C/C++ and ~~GDI+~~ GDI that presents a graphical interface and takes advantage of screen estate on high definition televisions or digital signage…

…coupled with a _server_ built in PHP (Zend Framework) that presents an administration interface, fetches and processes data, and provides an API with which the client receives playlists and data.

Inspired by necessity at an educational institution, this tool will be developed as open source and released for use as permitted by the licence. A hosted service may come into existence, providing a stable and supported installation of the server.
