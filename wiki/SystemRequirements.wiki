= System Requirements =

== Server ==
The Display UI server is powered by PHP, and requires the following components, at minimum:
  * PHP 5.2.4
   * Hash extension
   * cURL (or sockets)
   * PDO (or MySQLi)
   * Safe mode off
   * Output buffering off
  * Apache 2.2
  * MySQL 5.0

Additionally, we recommend a setup with the following configuration:
  * Alternative PHP Cache

== Client ==

The Display UI client is built in C/C++ and GDI, and has only been tested with the following prerequisites:
